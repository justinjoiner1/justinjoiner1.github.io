          <h4> Hello, My name is Justin. I am currently a sophomore at the College of Staten Island. My current major is Political Science. I am studying to be a lawyer in the future.
          <h4> Besides law, one thing I am very interested in is Mental Health Awareness. I believe your mental health is just as important as your physical health. </h4>
          <h4> For me, mental health is important becuase your mental ability is what makes you who you are. Within my family, I have some loved ones who struggle with mental illness. </h4>
          <h4> A couple ways to combat mental illness is with Therapy, Rehabilitation, and Medically prescribed antidepressants. </h4>
